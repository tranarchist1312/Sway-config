# Sway-config
This is a modified version of the default config. 
Some parts of this config make us of software which isn't included in the arch sway build, and will not work without said software. Such dependencies are always mentioned in a comment preceding the function that requires it, and I have included a list of all the needed software in the beginning of the file. Please make sure to read the comments in the file. 
This is merely a template for my setup so feel free to modify it to your liking.
