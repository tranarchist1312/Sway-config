# Sway-config
This is a modified version of the default config. 
To use a sway config file, create a directory ~/.config/sway/ and copy the file into that directory. 
Some parts of this config make us of software which isn't included in the arch sway build, and will not work without said software. Such dependencies are always mentioned in a comment preceding the function that requires it, and I have included a list of all the needed software in the beginning of the file
